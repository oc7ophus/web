Here’s the method I use that works for me, though it sounds horrible: I call it “banging your head against a wall until it sticks,” which is a portmanteau of two other phrases that I think sums it up pretty well, haha. I’m gonna assume you’re studying something in STEM, because if it’s history or a language or literature that’s a different method.

Basically, START by cramming. Find or make an outline of every topic the class or exam will cover and binge the related material in one go. Write it on loose leaf printer paper, it can be ugly. Doesn’t matter if you understand it or not. Just get exposure to everything once. Best way to do this I’ve found is to watch a YouTube series of the class at 2x or 1.5x speed. You don’t even need to watch it in order if you get bored. Just make sure you see everything. Rewind a video or rewatch others if you get confused, but don’t get stuck on any one thing.

Got it? Done? Great! Now rewrite your topic list/outline on another paper or papers during or after the binge with more details: subtopics, methods, equations, diagrams, whatever. Just get your head around what you’re going to need to have in your brain, get it organized so it’s not all one big nebulous mush of info.

Organize the outline in whatever way works for you. I like to order topics by what builds on what, which might not be the same order it’s taught in class, and then group them into chunks like chapters. Rewrite the new version on another sheet of paper, neater.

Now watch everything again and take notes, long notes, explanatory notes as if this paper is all you’ll get afterwards, and put them in each category. After each topic, stop and do practice problems of that part in isolation. Use your notes as a resource. Use answer keys if you get really stuck, but only as a last resort, since that can make you think you get something you really don’t.

Based on your experience with the practice problems, cut down your notes to the essentials. Rewrite them on another sheet of paper, keep explanatory parts if you need to, make them neat. Move onto the next section and repeat.

If you get stuck at any point, schedule a body doubling or, ideally, a tutoring session you have to show up for sometime in the future, then take a break. Come back to it if you can, but if not, use that session to break through and keep going.

After each section, go back to the previous ones and reread the notes and make sure you feel you get them. Do practice problems if you can. If you get them right, try to explain the topic to someone else. If you can do that, you’ve got it.

Keep your pile of sheets separate from the sheets you’re working on for one section. One sheet at a time. Also, only use one side of each paper, no double sided stuff.

By the end of all this, you should have a ton of notes. Now, consolidate those notes as much as possible into one cheat sheet per topic. After that, read them, look at them, over and over again until you can see them in your head a bit when you’re not looking at them.

Now try a practice exam. If you miss stuff, do those problems again. Watch the videos again. Read your notes again. Try more problems, another exam. Take a break. Study again. Even try to rewrite everything you can remember, no notes, from scratch, like a textbook. Eventually it will all stick.

The core idea of this method is exposing your brain to the material as much as possible so you can call up your memories of studying faster and more clearly when your notes aren’t in front of you, until you’ve internalized the material as a fact of life as simple as the sky being blue.

It sucks, it’s hard, but you can actually do all this faster than you think, and as you go, you’ll feel better and better about what you know and your progress. At minimum, try to at least open a video each day. Don’t let yourself run and hide.

Good luck!

## Minute method

My therapist gave me a really helpful guide that's supposed to trick your brain. It's called the, 'Bare Minimum Mind Hack.' 

- Clear your workspace
- Set a one minute timer
- Close your eyes
- Do the box breathing method until the timer goes off

> [!info]- Method
> 
> Box breathing involves four basic steps, each lasting 4 seconds:
> 1. breathing in
> 2. holding the breath
> 3. breathing out
> 4. holding the breath

- Setup bare minimum necessary resources
	- This should take about 5-15 minutes
- Set another one minute timer
- Race the timer, aiming to do as much work as you can in that one minute.

`potato -w <>`

- Reset the timer, five minutes this time
- Then thirty minutes.
	- If you can keep going, do it! If not, restart the thirty minute timer.

The aim is to maintain the inertial focus. Keep the ball rolling.
Sprint through the work as fast as you can.

If used five days a week, it can result in three hours of output per week at a minimum! (Far more than we would usually go in an ADHD fit.
