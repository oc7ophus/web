> Figure 1 shows the design for a structure used to support a roof
> 
> The structure consists of four steel beams$, AB, BD, BC \,$ and $\, AD \,$
> 
> Given $\, AB = 12 \text{m}, BC = BD = 7 \text{m} \,$ and angle $\, BAC = 27 ^{\boldsymbol{\circ}} \,$
> 
> (a) find, to one decimal place, the size of angle $\, ACB \,$
> 
> 
> The steel beams can only be bought in whole metre lengths
> 
> (b) Find the minimum length of steel that needs to be bought to make the complete structure
