doug revision strategy:

- write out plans to answer x number of questions
- find what you don't know
- answer questions

missing trig revision page
need small angle approx and explaining scs cot etc

missing algebraic division page

## Exam notes

Large dataset values
- Need to understand the units, to suggest sensible values.
- i.e., daily mean pressure hPa

Hypothesis testing
- Remembered hypothesis declaration $H_0, \quad H_1$
- Forgot how to carry out the test and find $p-$value
	- $P\sim B\left( \frac{1}{3}, 15 \right) \quad \quad H_{0}$
	- $n = 32, \quad n_{\text{success}} = 16, \quad \left( p_{2} = \frac{1}{2} \right) 5\% \;\text{sig}$

Box and Whisker plots
- Not too great at reading them generally

Equiv
- Probably need to revise algebraic division too

$$
\frac{ax^{2} + bx + c}{(x + n)(x + n)} \equiv A + \frac{B}{(x + n)} + \frac{C}{(x + n_{1})}
$$

Models
- Particle $P$ modelled as
	- $V = at^{2} + bt + c + k, \quad \quad t \geq 0$
	- (where $k$ is a constant)

Curves
- Finding distance and area of a curve from $y = 0, \quad y = a, \quad a \in \group { R }$

Derivatives applied
- Finding distance by deriving velocity, distance from velo etc

That damn circle tangent question
- Revise how to find the tangent and normal from a circle to line eq and vice versa

Notation
- Q1 has both $f(x)$ and $ff(x)$
- $f(x) = \frac{x + a_{1}}{x + b_{1}}$
- $ff(x) = \frac{ax + b}{x + b_{1} - 1}$
	- Where $a, b$ are integers to be found

Graph transformations
- Sketch curves noting down any points (like $y$ intercept roots etc)
- Brush up on graph transformations on curves
	- i.e., $f(x) = ax^{2} + bx + c \quad \r \quad f(x) - 2x$
	- $y = (x + a)^{2}$
	- etc

Domains
	State the range of $f$ 

Triple angle formulae
	Harmonic form (?)
