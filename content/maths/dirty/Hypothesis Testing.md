#### What is a hypothesis test?

- A hypothesis test uses a **sample of data** in an experiment to test a **statement** made about the value of a **population parameter**
- A hypothesis test is used when the value of the assumed population parameter is questioned
- The hypothesis test will look at the which outcomes are unlikely to occur if assumed population parameter is true
- The probability found will be compared against a given **significance level** to determine whether there is **evidence to believe** that the assumed population parameter is not true

Every hypothesis test must begin with:
- A clear null hypothesis (what we believe to already be true)
	- $\text{H}_{0}$
- And an alternative hypothesis (how we believe the data pattern or probability distribution might have changed)
	- $\text{H}_{1}$


- A **hypothesis** is an assumption that is made about a particular **population parameter**
    - A **population parameter** is a numerical characteristic which helps define a population
        - One example of a population parameter is the **probability, _p_**  of an event occurring
        - Another example is the mean of a population
    - The **null hypothesis** is denoted **H0** and sets out the assumed population parameter given that no change has happened
    - The **alternative hypothesis** is denoted **H1**  and sets out how we think the population parameter could have changed
    - When a hypothesis test is carried out, the null hypothesis is **assumed to be true** and this assumption will either be **accepted** or **rejected**

	- A hypothesis test could be a **one-tailed** test or a **two-tailed** test
- The null hypothesis will always be **H0 : _θ_ = ...**
- The alternate hypothesis will depend on if it is a one-tailed or two-tailed test
    - A one-tailed test would test to see if the **population parameter, _θ_****,** has **either increased or decreased**
        - The **alternative hypothesis, H1**  **will be H1** : **_θ > ..._**  **or**  **H1** : **_θ < ..._**
    - A two-tailed test would test to see if the **population parameter, _θ_** , has **changed**
        - The **alternative hypothesis,** **H1**  **will be H1** : **_θ ≠ ..._**  
    - It is important to read the wording of the question carefully to decide whether your hypothesis test should be one-tailed or two-tailed
- To carry out a hypothesis test an experiment will be carried out on a **sample of data**, the result of this experiment will be the **test statistic**
    - A **sample of data** is a subset of data taken from the population
    - The **test statistic** is a numerical value calculated from the of data
- A hypothesis test will always be carried out at an appropriate **significance level**
    - The significance level sets the **smallest probability** that an event could have occurred by chance.
        - Any probability smaller than the significance level would suggest that the event is unlikely to have happened by chance
    - The **significance level** must be set **before** the hypothesis test is carried out
    - The significance level will usually be 1%, 5% or 10%, however it may vary
