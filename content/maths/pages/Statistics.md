Samples vs Census
- Samples are a part of the population
- Census is the entire population

Sampling to destruction; a census is not appropriate for something such as testing 100% of products.

Sampling frame
- Simple Random Sample - Fairly picking at random from sampling frame
	- Picking names using randomness; using a die etc.
	- Using a random number generator

- Systematic Sample - Picking every $n^{\t{th}}$ person
	- Randomise starting point to preserve fairness

- Stratified Sample - Represented from certain perspectives
	- Split up the population into individual Stratum
	- You pick from each Strata in proportion to their population
	- Within each Stratum, carry out SRS.

Without Sampling frame
- Opportunity - Sample units as they occur
	- For example: Standing somewhere and ask people questions
- Quota - Stratified Opportunity
	- Split population into Strata
	- Each Stratum has a quota based on population
	- Opportunity sample until each Quota is filled
	- Discarding excess data.

## Scenarios

Options for sample:
	Census
	SRS
	Systematic
	Stratified
	Opportunity
	Quota

Class's average height
	Census; as the class' population is small enough to easily question all students.

Average height of 16-18yo in the country
	~~SRS; There are now too many people too measure all of them. You will be able to ask $n\%$~~
	Quota

Average breaking strain of 20 boutique climbing ropes
	Systematic; to get a good spread over a small amount of boutique products.

Average number of data write operations of USB sticks in a factory
	~~SRS; Since there is an abundance of USB sticks, you will easily be able to randomly pick $n\%$ to test~~ (Only if you had a pile)
	Systematically; as it would be trivial to sample on an assembly line

Average length of big cats in Africa
	Opportunity
