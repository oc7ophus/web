The point-slope form of the equation of a line is a way to write the equation of a line when you know:

1. A point $(x_1,y_1)$ through which the line passes.
2. The slope $m$ of the line.

The point-slope form is given by: 

$$y−y_1 = m (x−x_1)$$

In this formula:

- $(x_1,y_1)$ is the point on the line.
- $m$ is the slope of the line.
- $x$ and $y$ are the variables representing any point on the line.

Let's apply this step to our example:

1. **Identify the point $(x_1,y_1)$ and the slope $m$:**
    
    From the previous steps:
    
    - The point $P$ is $(1,−2)$
    - The slope $m$ of the tangent line at $P$ is $4$.
	
2. **Substitute the values into the point-slope form:**
    
    $y−y_1=m(x−x_1)$
    
    Substituting $(x_1​,y_1​)=(1,−2)$ and $m=4$:
    
    $y−(−2)=4(x−1)$
    
3. **Simplify the equation:**
    
    $y+2=4(x−1)$
    
    Now, distribute the $4$ on the right side:
    
    $y+2=4x−4$
    
4. **Isolate $y$ to write the equation in slope-intercept form $y=mx+c$:**
    
    Subtract $2$ from both sides:
    
    $y=4x−4−2$
    
    Simplify the right side:
    
    $y=4x−6$
    

So, the equation of the tangent line in slope-intercept form is: $y=4x−6$

## Point-Slope form

$$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$$

- $(x1, y1):$ A point on the line
- $m:$ Slope of the line
- $x, y:$ Variables representing any point on the line


## Tangent example

$$
\begin{align}
 & m = f'(x_{0}) \\
 & y - y_{0} = m(x - x_{0})
\end{align}
