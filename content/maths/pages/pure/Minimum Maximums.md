When deriving, you are finding the gradient at a point on a function.

In other words, you are finding the *horizontal* line at the mini/max

So, the equation of the line would be $y = n$

In terms of $y = mx + c,$ the gradient would be $0$.

$y = 0x + n$
$\r y = n$

So, when finding a mini/max, $\frac{dy}{dx} = 0$, because we want the gradient that is found to equal $0$, which will give us our horizontal line.

To confirm if your gradient is a minimum or maximum, find the second derivative, and substitute in $x$. If it is $+\t{tve},$ It will be a minimum (As the gradient will tend upwards), and if it is $-\t{tve},$ It will be a maximum.
