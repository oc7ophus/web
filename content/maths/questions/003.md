I would simplify $\sqrt{ 18 }$ to $\sqrt{ 2 } \cdot \sqrt{ n }$, then multiply everything by $2$, to rationalize the surds.
From there, I would collect the like terms and the answer should be finished.
I failed to realise here I should have factored $x$ out

$$
\begin{align}
 & x \sqrt{ 2 } - \sqrt{ 18 } = x \\ 
 & x \sqrt{ 2 } - 3 \sqrt{ 2 } = x \\
 & 2x - x\sqrt{ 2 } = 6 \\ 
 & x (2 - \sqrt{ 2 }) = 6 \\ 
 & x = \frac{6}{2 - \sqrt{ 2 }} \\ 
 & x = 3 - \frac{6}{\sqrt{ 2 }} \\ 
 & x = 3 - 3\sqrt{ 2 }
\end{align}
$$

First I would rationalize the denominator of the fraction
I would then try to cancel out the power on the right either with laws of indices or logarithms.
