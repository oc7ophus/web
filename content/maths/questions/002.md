$$
\begin{align}
 & A (4, -2) \\ 
 & B (-3, -4) \\ 
 & C (4, -4) \\ 
 & \text{Let ABC form a triangle}
\end{align}
$$


$$
\begin{align}
 & \ol{AB} = \sqrt{ 7^{2} + 2^{2} } \\
 & \ol{AB} = \sqrt{ 53 } \\ 
\end{align}
$$

$$
\begin{align}
 & \frac{b}{\sin B} = \frac{c}{\sin C} \\ \\
 & \frac{\sin B}{7} = \frac{\sin 90}{\sqrt {53} } \\ \\
 & B = \sin ^{-1}(0.1228 \cdot 7) \\
 & B = 59.272 ^{\boldsymbol{\circ}} 
\end{align}
$$

Bearing relative from $O$

$$
\begin{align}
 & 59.3 + 180 = 239.3 ^{\boldsymbol{\circ}} 
\end{align}
$$

Calculating speed

$$
\begin{align}
t & = \frac{45}{60} + 2  \\
 \frac{\sqrt{ 53 }}{2.75} & = 2.647 \,\text{km}\,\text{h}^{-1}
\end{align}
$$
