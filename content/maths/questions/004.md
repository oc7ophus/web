> In 1997 the average $\, \text{CO}_{2} \,$ emissions of the new cars in the UK was $\, 190\text{g} /\text{km}\,$
> In 2005 the average $\, \text{CO}_{2} \,$ emissions of new cars in the UK had fallen to $\, 169\text{g} / \text{km} \,$
> 
> Given $\, A\, g / \text{km} \,$ is the average $\, \text{CO}_{2} \,$ emissions of new cars in the UK $n$ years after 1997 and using a linear model,
> 
> (a) form an equation linking $A$ with $n$.
> 
> In 2016 the average $\, \text{CO}_{2} \,$ emissions of new cars in the UK was $\, 120\, \text{g} / \text{kg} \,$
