> A curve has the equation $y = g(x)$
> 
> Given that
> - $g(x)$ is a cubic expression in which the coefficient of $x^{3}$ is equal to the coefficient of $x$
> - the curve with equation $y = g(x)$ passes through the origin
> - the curve with equation $y = g(x)$ has a stationary point at $(2,9)$
> 
> (a) find $g(x)$
> 
> (b) prove that the stationary point at $(2, 9)$ is a maximum
