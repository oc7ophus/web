## Algorithmic complexity / Big-O / Asymptotic analysis

- Nothing to implement here, you're just watching videos and taking notes! Yay!
- There are a lot of videos here. Just watch enough until you understand it. You can always come back and review.
- Don't worry if you don't understand all the math behind it.
- You just need to understand how to express the complexity of an algorithm in terms of Big-O.

Well, that's about enough of that.

When you go through "Cracking the Coding Interview", there is a chapter on this, and at the end there is a quiz to see
if you can identify the runtime complexity of different algorithms. It's a super review and test.
