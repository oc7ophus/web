## Interview Prep Books

You don't need to buy a bunch of these. Honestly "Cracking the Coding Interview" is probably enough,
but I bought more to give myself more practice. But I always do too much.

I bought both of these. They gave me plenty of practice.

- [Programming Interviews Exposed: Coding Your Way Through the Interview, 4th Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Interviews-Exposed-Through-Interview/dp/111941847X/)
    - Answers in C++ and Java
    - This is a good warm-up for Cracking the Coding Interview
    - Not too difficult. Most problems may be easier than what you'll see in an interview (from what I've read)
- [Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th Edition](http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-6th-Programming/dp/0984782850/)
    - answers in Java
