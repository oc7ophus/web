## Additional Books

    These are here so you can dive into a topic you find interesting.

- [The Unix Programming Environment](https://www.amazon.com/dp/013937681X)
    - An oldie but a goodie
- [The Linux Command Line: A Complete Introduction](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1593273894/)
    - A modern option
- [TCP/IP Illustrated Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP/IP_Illustrated)
- [Head First Design Patterns](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596007124/)
    - A gentle introduction to design patterns
- [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612)
    - AKA the "Gang Of Four" book or GOF
    - The canonical design patterns book
- [Algorithm Design Manual](http://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1849967202) (Skiena)
    - As a review and problem-recognition
    - The algorithm catalog portion is well beyond the scope of difficulty you'll get in an interview
    - This book has 2 parts:
        - Class textbook on data structures and algorithms
            - Pros:
                - Is a good review as any algorithms textbook would be
                - Nice stories from his experiences solving problems in industry and academia
                - Code examples in C
            - Cons:
                - Can be as dense or impenetrable as CLRS, and in some cases, CLRS may be a better alternative for some subjects
                - Chapters 7, 8, and 9 can be painful to try to follow, as some items are not explained well or require more brain than I have
                - Don't get me wrong: I like Skiena, his teaching style, and mannerisms, but I may not be Stony Brook material
        - Algorithm catalog:
            - This is the real reason you buy this book.
            - This book is better as an algorithm reference, and not something you read cover to cover.
    - Can rent it on Kindle
    - Answers:
        - [Solutions](https://web.archive.org/web/20150404194210/http://www.algorithm.cs.sunysb.edu/algowiki/index.php/The_Algorithms_Design_Manual_(Second_Edition))
    - [Errata](http://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~skiena/algorist/book/errata)
- [Algorithm](http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/) (Jeff Erickson)
- [Write Great Code: Volume 1: Understanding the Machine](https://www.amazon.com/Write-Great-Code-Understanding-Machine/dp/1593270038)
    - The book was published in 2004, and is somewhat outdated, but it's a terrific resource for understanding a computer in brief
    - The author invented [HLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Level_Assembly), so take mentions and examples in HLA with a grain of salt. Not widely used, but decent examples of what assembly looks like
    - These chapters are worth the read to give you a nice foundation:
        - Chapter 2 - Numeric Representation
        - Chapter 3 - Binary Arithmetic and Bit Operations
        - Chapter 4 - Floating-Point Representation
        - Chapter 5 - Character Representation
        - Chapter 6 - Memory Organization and Access
        - Chapter 7 - Composite Data Types and Memory Objects
        - Chapter 9 - CPU Architecture
        - Chapter 10 - Instruction Set Architecture
        - Chapter 11 - Memory Architecture and Organization
- [Introduction to Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-fourth-Thomas-Cormen/dp/026204630X)
    - **Important:** Reading this book will only have limited value. This book is a great review of algorithms and data structures, but won't teach you how to write good code. You have to be able to code a decent solution efficiently
    - AKA CLR, sometimes CLRS, because Stein was late to the game
- [Computer Architecture, Sixth Edition: A Quantitative Approach](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0128119055)
    - For a richer, more up-to-date (2017), but longer treatment
