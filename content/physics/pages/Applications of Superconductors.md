- Superconductors are useful for applications that require large electric currents
- Therefore, they are useful for:
    
    - The production of strong magnetic fields
    - The reduction of energy loss / dissipation in the transmission of electric power
    
- Such applications which require these could be:
    
    - MRI scanners
    - Transformers & generators - for fewer fire risks
    - Motors
    - Monorail trains
    - Maglev (magnetic levitation) trains
    - Particle accelerators - need large magnetic fields to accelerate particles
    - Fusion reactors
    - Electromagnets
    - Power / electrical cables
    - Microchips
    
- Maglev trains require extremely strong electromagnets to levitate the train due to such a large mass
    - This means they can travel at extremely high speeds up to 603 km / h
    - Maglev train systems currently only exist in Japan, South Korea and China
