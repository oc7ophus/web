- As the potential difference (voltage) across a component is increased, the current also increases (by Ohm’s law)
- The precise relationship between voltage and current is different for different components and can be shown on an _I-V_ graph
    - For an ohmic conductor, the _I_–_V_ graph is a straight line through the origin
    - For a semiconductor diode, the _I_–_V_ graph is a horizontal line that goes sharply upwards
    - For a filament lamp, the _I_–_V_ graph has an 'S' shaped curve

#### Ohmic Conductor

- The _I–V_ graph for an ohmic conductor at constant temperature e.g. a resistor is very simple:
    
    - The current is **directly proportional** to the potential difference
    - This is demonstrated by the **straight-line** graph through the origin
    

#### Semiconductor Diode

- The _I–V_ graph for a semiconductor diode is slightly different. A diode is used in a circuit to allow current to flow only in a specific direction:
    
    - When the current is in the direction of the arrowhead symbol, this is **forward bias.** This is shown by the sharp increase in potential difference and current on the right side of the graph
    - When the diode is switched around, it does not conduct and is called **reverse bias.** This is shown by a zero reading of current or potential difference on the left side of the graph
    

#### Filament Lamp

- The _I–V_ graph for a filament lamp shows the current increasing at a proportionally slower rate than the potential difference
- This is because:
    
    - As the current increases, the **temperature** of the filament in the lamp **increases**
    - Since the filament is a metal, the higher temperature causes an **increase** in **resistance**
    - Resistance opposes the current, causing the **current** to **increase** at a **slower rate**
    
- Where the graph is a straight line, the resistance is constant
- The resistance increases as the graph curves
- The filament lamp obeys Ohm's Law for small voltages

For an [?] graph of an ohmic conductor (at constant [?]):
- The [?] is directly proportional to the [? ?]
- This is demonstrated by the [?-?] graph through the [?]
?
For an **I–V** graph of an ohmic conductor (at constant **temperature**):
- The **current** is directly proportional to the **potential difference**
- This is demonstrated by the **straight-line** graph through the **origin**

For an [?] graph of a semiconductor diode:
- When the [?] is in the direction of the [? ?], this is [? ?].
	- Shown by the sharp increase in [? ?] and [?] on the side of the graph

For an **I–V** graph of a semiconductor diode:
- When the **current** is in the direction of the **arrowhead symbol**, this is **forward bias**.
	- Shown by the sharp increase in **potential difference** and **current** on the side of the graph
<!--SR:!2024-07-10,1,230-->



For an [?] graph of a semiconductor diode:
- When the diode is **switched around**, it does not [?] and is called [? ?].
	- This is shown by a [? ?] of [?] or [? ?] on the side of the graph
?
For an **I–V** graph of a semiconductor diode:
- When the diode is ***switched around***, it does not **conduct** and is called **reverse bias**.
	- This is shown by a **zero reading** of **current** or **potential difference** on the side of the graph

For an **I–V** graph of a filament lamp:
The **current** increases at a **proportionally slower rate** than the **potential difference** because $\dots$
?
As the **current increases**, the **temperature** of the **filament** in the **lamp increases**
Since the **filament** is a **metal**, the **higher temperature** causes an **increase in resistance**
**Resistance** **opposes** the **current**, causing the current to increase at a **slower rate**
