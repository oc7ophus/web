- All materials have some resistivity - even good electrical conductors such as copper and silver
- Resistance means that when electricity flows through a material, it heats up and the electrical energy is wasted as thermal energy
    
    - The resistivity of a material can be lowered by lowering its temperature
    
- If a material is cooled below a temperature called the critical temperature, its resistivity disappears entirely. It is now a **superconductor**
- Therefore, a superconductor (or superconducting material) is defined as

**A material with no resistance below a critical temperature**

- The critical temperature is defined as

**The temperature at which a material becomes superconducting**

- A common superconducting material is mercury
    
    - Mercury has a critical temperature of 4.2 K
    
- The electrical resistivity against temperature for a normal metal compared to a superconductor can be shown on the following graph:

- Superconductivity is a property of only certain materials that have the characteristics above
- This temperature threshold is sometimes referred to as theÂ **transition temperature**
