**For a conductor at a constant temperature, the current through it is proportional to the potential difference across it**

- Constant temperature implies constant resistance
- Ohm's law is represented in the equation below:

The relation between potential difference across an electrical component (in this case, a fixed resistor) and the current can be investigated through a circuit such as the one below

- By adjusting the resistance on the variable resistor, the current and potential difference will vary in the circuit
- Measuring the variation of current with potential difference through the fixed resistor will produce a straight line graph, such as the one below

- Since the gradient is constant, the resistance _R_ of the resistor can be calculated by using **1 ÷ gradient** of the graph
- An electrical component obeys Ohm’s law if its graph of current against potential difference is a **straight line** through the origin
    
    - A resistor **does** obey Ohm’s law
    - A filament lamp does **not** obey Ohm’s law
    
- This applies to any metal wires, provided that the current isn’t large enough to increase their temperature
