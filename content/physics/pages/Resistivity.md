## Resistivity

- All materials have some **resistance** to the flow of charge
- As **free** **electrons** **move** through a metal wire, they collide with ions which get in their way
- As a result, they **transfer** some, or all, of their **kinetic** **energy** on **collision**, which causes electrical **heating**

- Since **current** is the **flow** of **charge**, the ions resisting their flow causes **resistance**
- Resistance depends on the **length** of the wire, the **cross-sectional area** through which the current is passing and the **resistivity** of the material

The resistivity equation shows that:

- The **longer** the wire, the **greater** its resistance
- The **thicker** the wire, the **smaller** its resistance

- Resistivity is a property that describes the extent to which a material opposes the flow of electric current through it
- It is a property of the material, and is dependent on temperature
- Resistivity is measured in **Ω m**

- The higher the resistivity of a material, the higher its resistance
- This is why copper, with its relatively low resistivity at room temperature, is used for electrical wires — current flows through it very easily
- Insulators have such a high resistivity that virtually no current will flow through them

### Resistivity

As free electrons move through a metal wire, they collide with [?] which get in their way.
As a result, they transfer some, or all, of their [? ?] on collision, which causes [? ?].

As free electrons move through a metal wire, they collide with **ions** which get in their way.
As a result, they transfer some, or all, of their **kinetic energy** on collision, which causes **electrical heating**.

Since current is [? ? ? ?], the [?] resisting their flow causes [?]
?
Since current is **the flow of charge**, the **ions** resisting their flow causes **resistance**

[?] is a property that describes the extent to which a material opposes the flow of electric current through it.
It is a property of the [?], and is dependent on [?], and is measured in [?].
