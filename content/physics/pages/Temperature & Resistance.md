- All solids are made up of vibrating atoms
    
    - The higher the temperature, the faster these atoms vibrate
    
- Electric current is the flow of free electrons in a material
    - The electrons collide with the vibrating atoms which impede their flow, hence the current **decreases**

- So, if the current decreases, then the resistance will increase (from _V_ = _IR_)
- Therefore, for a metallic conductor which obeys Ohm's law:
    
    - An **increase** in temperature causes an **increase** in resistance
    - A **decrease** in temperature causes a **decrease** in resistance
    
- This is **not** the case for components such as a thermistor
    - For a thermistor, an **increase** in temperature causes a **decrease** in resistance


## Flashcards

[? ?] is the [?] of free electrons in a material, as the temperature increases:
- Electrons [?] more frequently with the [? ?] which [?] their flow, hence the current [?]
- So, if the current [?], then the [? ?] (from V = IR)
?
**Electric current** is the **flow** of free electrons in a material, as the temperature increases:
- Electrons **collide** more frequently with the **vibrating atoms** which **impede** their flow, hence the current **decreases**
- So, if the current **decreases**, then the **resistance increases** (from V = IR)

For a [?] conductor which obeys Ohm's law:
- An **increase** in temperature causes an [?] in resistance
- A [?] in temperature causes a [?] in resistance
