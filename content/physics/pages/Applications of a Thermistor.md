- A thermistor is a non-ohmic conductor and sensory resistor whose resistance varies with temperature
- Most thermistors are negative temperature coefficient (ntc) components.
    
    - This means that if the temperature **increases,** the resistance of the thermistor **decreases** (and vice versa)
    
- The temperature-resistance graph for a thermistor is shown below

Thermistors are temperature sensors and are used in circuits in ovens, fire alarms and digital thermometers

- As the thermistor gets **hotter**, its resistance **decreases**
- As the thermistor gets **cooler**, its resistance **increases**

Most thermistors are [?] temperature [?] components.
- As [? ?], the resistance of the thermistor [?] (and vice versa)
?
Most thermistors are **negative** temperature **coefficient** components.
- As **temperature increases**, the resistance of the thermistor **decreases** (and vice versa)
