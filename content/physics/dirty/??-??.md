(Car taking a turn)
Tires provide the friction required to deliver the centripetal force

Forces:

$\uparrow$ Normal

$\leftarrow$ Drag & Air res

$\downarrow$ Weight

$\rightarrow$ Thrust

Friction moves towards the centre of the centripetal force circle

As the radius decreases, the turning force will ... friction and lose traction, (going off the road)



(Spinning a weight)
The tension in the string keeps the weight going around when spun

(Going down a slide)
The normal force against the surface

(Rollercoaster loop)
Not friction, the normal force pushing down and applying a centripetal force

(Electron orbits)
Electrostatic force

Why are cyclists race on banked tracks with a low friction surface

 





## SLIDE 2

Understand that a resultant force (centripetal force) is required to produce and maintain circular motion

Explain the motion of a marble rolling on the surface 

Understand what is meant by angular velocity

Be able to use the equations $v = \omega r$
and $T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega}$

Angular Displacement

The angle through which something has rotated

$\theta = \frac{s}{r}$

Angular Velocity

The angle rotated per second
The angular velocity of a particle is the rate at which it rotates around a chosen centre point

The angular velocity $\omega$ is 

$\omega = \frac{\d \theta}{\d t}$


Explain the motion of a marble rolling on the surface of a table in a train as the train corners:

If the train turns to the left, the marble will appear to drift off to the right because there's no resultant force (i.e., No wall for normal force), thus the ball continues moving in a straight line 

According to N2L, a resultant force causes and acceleration explain how a satellite can accelerate when ts speeds remains constant

This is because the magnitude of the velocity remains the same, while the direction of velocity changes

If the London Eye rotates once every 30 minutes, what is it's angular velocity?

$\omega = \frac{360}{30\times 60}$

The earth turns every day. What is it's angular velocity?

$\omega = \frac{360}{24 \times 360}$
$\r 0.04167$

The instantaneous tangential (linear) velocity at a point in a circle is given the letter $v$ and measured in $\ms$

$v = \frac{s}{t}$

$v = \frac{2 \pi r}{T}$

Periodic time T is for one rotation

Why is the edge of a carousel the fastest at the edge?

$v = \frac{2\pi r}{t}$

As you approach the edge, the circumference grows which increases the force

A child swings a bucket of water in a horizontal circle. The maximum tension the string can withstand is $10 \t N$.
How fast is the bucket travelling at max speed?

The mass of the bucket is $0.890\t {kg}$ and the child's arm is $65\t{cm}$ long

$F = m \omega ^2 r$

$10 = 0.89 \times \omega ^2 \times 0.65$
