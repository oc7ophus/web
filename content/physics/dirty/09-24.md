A satellite of mass $\, m \,$ is moving at a speed $\, v \,$ at a constant height $\, h \,$ above the Earth's surface, $(r_{E}$ is the radius of the Earth $)$

1: Satellites which orbit the Earth with a time period of 24 hours are in geostationary orbit. Calculate the height of such a satellite over the Earth.

An atom absorbs a photon, its electron becomes excited because the energy levels are discrete and specific, change in energy level is equal to the photo energy.
