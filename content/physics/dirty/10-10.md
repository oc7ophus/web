$$
\begin{align}
 & E = \frac{F}{Q_{2}} \\ \\ 
 & E = k \frac{Q_{1}Q_{2}}{r^{2}Q_{2}} \\ 
 & \r k \frac{Q_{1}}{r^{2}} \\ \\ 
 & E = \frac{kQ}{r^{2}}
\end{align}

EFS and PD in a radial field

$$
\begin{align}
 & E = \frac{kQ}{r^{2}} \\ \\
 & E = \frac{\d V}{\d d}
\end{align}
$$

What is the EFS at $X$ is the protons are $0.78 \text{mm}$ apart?

$$
\begin{align}
 & E_{p_{1}} = k \frac{+e}{(2d)^{2}} \quad \quad E_{p_{2}} = k \frac{+e}{d^{2}} \\ \\ 
 & E_\text{total} = k \frac{+e }{d^{2}} - k \frac{+e }{(2d)^{2}} \\ \\ 
 & E_\text{total} = ke \frac{1}{d^{2}}\left( 1 - \frac{1}{4} \right) = \frac{3ke}{4d^{2}} \\ \\ 
 & E_\text{total} = \frac{3 \cdot 9 \cdot 10^{9} \cdot 1.6 \cdot 10^{-19}}{4 \cdot (0.26 \cdot 10^{-3})^{2}} \\ \\ 
 & E_\text{total} = 0.016 \text{NC}^{-1}
\end{align}
$$

If the total distance is $3d,\; d = 0.26 \text{mm}$

Rearranging Kepler's Formula (probably ?)

$$
\begin{align}
\cancel{ m } \omega^{2} r & = \frac{GM \cancel{ m }}{r^{2}}  \\ \\
\omega^{2} & = \frac{GM}{r^{3}} \quad \quad \quad
    \left( \omega = \frac{2\pi}{T} \right) \\ \\
\frac{4\pi^{2}}{T ^{2}} & = \frac{GM}{r^{2}} \\ \\
T^{2} & = \frac{r^{3} \cdot 4\pi^{2}}{GM} \\ \\
 & G, M, \pi \;\text{are all constants} \\ 
\therefore \;\; & T^{2} \propto \, r^{3}
\end{align}

# Electric field strength and PD in a uniform field

In a **uniform electric field**, the field strength is constant throughout the field and points in a specific direction. A uniform electric field is often created between two parallel plates connected to a voltage source.

![[Pasted image 20241010142915.png]]

The formula for electric field strength in a uniform field:

$$
E = \frac{V} {d}
$$

- $E$ is the electric field strength (in volts per meter, V/m)
- $V$ is the potential difference (in volts, V) between the plates
- $d$ is the separation (in meters, m) between the plates

EFS is the measure of the force experienced by a unit positive charge in an electric field, it tells us how strong the electric field is at any point and the direction in which a positive charge would move.

This equation shows that the electric field strength is directly proportional to the potential difference between the plates and inversely proportional to the distance between them.

In a uniform electric field, the field lines are parallel and equally spaced, indicating that the field strength is the same everywhere between the plates.

## Potential difference

The potential difference between two points in an electric field is the work done to move a unit charge from one point to the other.

- In the context of a uniform electric field, the potential difference between the plates can be understood as the energy difference per unit charge as the charge moves between them.

![[Pasted image 20241010143308.png]]

In simpler terms:

- If a positive charge moves in the direction of the electric field, it loses potential energy (it moves towards lower potential).
- If a charge moves against the electric field, it gains potential energy (it moves towards higher potential).

---

## Derivation of EFS

When two points in an electric field have a different potential, there is a **potential difference** between them
- To move a charge across that potential difference, **work** needs to be done
- Two parallel plates with a potential difference $V$ across them create a uniform electric field

The electric field strength between the plates is given by the equations:

$$
\begin{align}
 & E = \frac{F}{Q} = \frac{V}{d} \\  \\
 & Fd = VQ
\end{align}
$$

When a charge $Q$ moves from one plate to the other, the work done on the charge by the field is:

$$
Fd = W
$$

## Thermionic emission

Thermionic emission is the process in which electrons are emitted from the surface of a metal when it is heated to a sufficiently high temperature.

- When the metal is heated, the thermal energy gives the electrons enough kinetic energy to overcome the attractive forces holding them within the metal. As a result, the electrons escape from the metal surface.

Key points about thermionic emission:

- **Temperature-driven:** The energy needed to liberate electrons comes from thermal energy (heat).
- **Work function $(\phi)$:** The minimum amount of energy needed for an electron to escape from the surface of the metal is called the work function of the metal.
- **Applications:** Thermionic emission is used in vacuum tubes, cathode ray tubes (CRTs), and electron guns in devices such as oscilloscopes or old TV sets.

The rate of electron emission in thermionic emission increases with temperature, as more electrons gain sufficient energy to escape.

---

## **Photoelectric Effect:

The **photoelectric effect** is the emission of electrons from the surface of a metal when it is exposed to electromagnetic radiation (usually light). 

- When light (or other electromagnetic waves) of a sufficiently high frequency shines on the metal, the energy from the photons can be transferred to the electrons, allowing them to overcome the work function and escape from the metal.

Key points about the photoelectric effect:

- **Light-driven:** The energy needed to liberate electrons comes from photons (packets of light energy).
- **Work function $(\phi)$:** The photoelectric effect also depends on the metal’s work function, but here, the energy comes from the photon rather than from heat.
- **Threshold frequency $(f_{0})$:** For a particular metal, there is a minimum frequency of light (threshold frequency) needed for electrons to be emitted. If the frequency of the incident light is below this threshold, no electrons are emitted, regardless of the light’s intensity.
- **Energy of the photons $(E)$:** The energy of a photon is given by $E = hf$, where:
	- $h$ is the Planck's constant
	- $f$ is the frequency of the light

If $hf$  (the energy of the photon) is greater than the work function $(\phi)$, the electron is emitted. Any excess energy appears as the kinetic energy of the emitted electron.

$$
hf = \phi + \frac{1}{2}mv^{2}
$$

where $mv^{2} / 2$  is the kinetic energy of the emitted electron.

In conclusion, **thermionic emission** relies on thermal energy to overcome the work function of the metal, with more electron emission at higher temperatures.
Whereas **he photoelectric effect** relies on photon energy (from light), and electron emission occurs only if the light’s frequency is above a certain threshold, regardless of intensity.

## Electron gun example

In an electron gun, thermionic emission, the photoelectric effect, and the potential difference across parallel plates all play a part in the generation, and direction in the produced electron beam.

**Thermionic Emission:**

- **Electron generation:** Inside the electron gun, a metal cathode is heated, causing electrons to be emitted through **thermionic emission**. The thermal energy gives electrons enough energy to escape the metal surface.
	- These emitted electrons form the source of the electron beam.

**Acceleration by Potential Difference:**

- **Electron acceleration:** A **potential difference (pd)** is applied between the heated cathode (negative) and a positively charged anode. 
	- The electric field created by this pd accelerates the electrons toward the anode.
- The greater the pd between the cathode and anode, the faster the electrons move, resulting in a higher kinetic energy electron beam.

**Control of Beam Direction:**

- **Parallel plates as deflectors:** After being accelerated, the electron beam passes through a region between two parallel plates while having a **potential difference** applied across them creating a **uniform electric field**.
- This electric field exerts a force on the electrons, causing the beam to deflect. The direction and degree of deflection depend on the polarity and strength of the pd across the plates.
- By controlling the potential difference across these plates, the electron beam can be steered or directed as needed.

In summary:

- **Thermionic emission** provides the electron beam by heating the cathode to emit electrons.
- **Potential difference** between the cathode and anode accelerates the electrons into a focused beam.
- **Parallel plates** with a pd apply an electric field to steer or deflect the electron beam in the desired direction.
